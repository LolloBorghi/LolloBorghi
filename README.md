#### " The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge. " -Stephen Hawking 

My life gist:

- 📚 I’m currently learning in my secondary school
- 👀 I’m interested in IT and Telecommunication.
- 👯‍♂️ I'm looking to collaborate on any idea that impresses me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to manage my time, and be productive.
- 💬 Ask me about Web Developement, Machine Learning, Community Building.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Lorenzo Borghi](mailto:info.borghilorenzo@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans)
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I love Green Tea.

I believe in a world where people from all over the world can collaborate in order to create impressive content. I do my best to collaborate and participate in the ideas that stimulate me.

Every day I challenge myself by learning from my mistakes, being inspired by my creativity.
